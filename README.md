# Data-Transmisssion-Through-Laser
One was the transmitter and the other was the receiver , the data was sent through blinking of the laser. The duration of the blink was responsible for transmission of bits. For example 2-5 ms of the LOW signal will mean a logical HIGH signal while a LOW signal of less than 2ms will be called as LOGICAL LOW.
